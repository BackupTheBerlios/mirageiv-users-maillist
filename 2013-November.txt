Subject: [Mirageiv-users] Improve russian translations
Message-ID: <CAMOkk_Y3y-GSpW4w=4U=pxq9CvDE5g8tCn2yC2xVa86JK69O1w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi! I've improved the Russian translation a bit. Updated ru.po is in
the attach. Thanks for the nice project.

Also, I have a feature request: Could you please add a drag-and-drop
feature so I could drag an image from Mirage (maybe not from it's main
window, but at least from the thumbnail pane) to, say, social network
site in browser?

Regards,
Sergey.
